This docker is set up to cater for my need to develop some personal projects that are based on Hadoop, Hive, Spark and Python.

The first project that I'm still working on based on this infrastructural environment is [weather forecasting](https://github.com/james-wukong/python-weather).

It would be very flexible if you want append extra services into this boilerplate, such kafka. Simply add it in docker-compose.yml.

## This is a develop env for Hadoop-Hive-Spark cluster + Jupyter on Docker

This docker is originated from [hadoop-hive-spark-docker](https://github.com/myamafuj/hadoop-hive-spark-docker)

This docker includes 7 containers (I removed jupyter container, so it is 6 containers for me):

- metastore container (postgres database)
- dev container (development container, hadoop, hive, spark, tensorflow and conda installed)
- master container (master container, containers, hadoop, hive, spark installed)
- two worker containers(containers, hadoop, hive, spark installed)
- history container(containers, hadoop, hive, spark installed)

and on top of that, a sparknet configured as below is needed. 

GPU part is commented, as it's not supported in my machine.

In case if you need add a kafka service in the future, you can simply add it as a service.

## Hadoop Dev

This is the main container that I use to have some practical work going on.

## Create docker network sparknet, with subnet and gateway configured

```sh
docker network create --driver=bridge \
    --subnet=172.28.0.0/16 \
    --gateway=172.28.255.254 \
    sparknet
```

```sh
# attach container to network(sparknet)
docker network connect sparknet container
```

```sh
# create conda env from file
conda create --name MySpark python=3.11
# or
conda env create --file ~/conda-env/hello-spark.yml
```

```sh
# create the mysql container and attach it to sparknet
docker run --name mysql -dit \
    --network sparknet \
    --hostname mysql \
    -p 3306:3306 \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
    -v ~/Documents/Docker-Volumns/mysql:/var/lib/mysql \
    mysql:latest

docker exec -it mysql mysql -p
```

```sh
# create mongodb container and attach it to sparknet
docker pull mongodb/mongodb-community-server

docker run --name mongo -dit \
    --network sparknet \
    --hostname mongodb \
    -p 27017:27017 \
    -v ~/Documents/Docker-Volumns/mongo:/data \
    -w /data \
    mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest

docker exec -it mongo mongosh
```

```sh
# run the container in terminal
docker exec -it hadoop_dev /bin/bash
```
